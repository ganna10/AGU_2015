            \item Surface temperatures predicted to increase due to climate change.
            \item What are the effects of increased temperatures on air quality?
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Increased emissions from vegetation (BVOCs).
                    \item Increased reaction rates atmospheric chemistry.
                    \item \ldots
                \end{itemize}
            \item What are the effects of increased temperatures on tropospheric ozone concentrations?
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Increased VOC emissions, especially BVOCs such as isoprene, are well-known to produce large amounts of ozone per molecule of VOC emitted.
                    \item Increased temperatures means that the PAN sink for peroxy radicals and \ce{NO2} is much less-effective at transporting RO2 and \ce{NO2} away from emission sources due to increased thermal decomposition rates.  
                \end{itemize}
            $\Rightarrow$ Future increases in ozone levels.
