            \item Ozone is produced from photochemistry of emitted VOC and \ce{NO_x}, VOC is the ``fuel'' and \ce{NO_x} the ``catalyst''. \vspace{5mm}
            \item Climate change will increase surface temperatures. \vspace{5mm}
            \item Temperature drives surface ozone in many areas. \vspace{5mm}
            \item Temperature influences ozone production by
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item increasing BVOC emissions from vegetation,
                    \item increasing reaction rates atmospheric chemistry.  \vspace{5mm}
                \end{itemize}
            \item Is increased BVOC emissions or increased chemistry more important for increasing ozone with temperature? \vspace{-2mm}
            \item Do chemical mechanisms used in models reproduce the relationship between ozone and temperature across \ce{NO_x} gradients?
