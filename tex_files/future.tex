            \item Compare simulated ozone--temperature to observations. \vspace{15mm}
            \item What are the most important temperature-dependent chemical processes? PAN decomposition? Increased radical production? \vspace{15mm}
            \item Why do CB05 and RADM2 produce more ozone than other mechanisms? \vspace{15mm}
