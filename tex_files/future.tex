            \item Compare simulated ozone--temperature to observations. \vspace{15mm}
            \item What are the most important temperature-dependent chemical processes? PAN decomposition? Other temperature-dependent reactions? \vspace{15mm}
            \item Why is ozone production in CB05 and RADM2 more sensitive to temperature than other mechanisms? \vspace{15mm}
