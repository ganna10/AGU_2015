            \item Compare rate of change of ozone with temperature in simulations and observations. \vspace{10mm}
            \item Which aspects of the increased chemistry is the most important? Decreased PAN lifetime? Increased radical production? \vspace{10mm}
            \item Determine why CB05 and RADM2 produce more ozone than other mechanisms. \vspace{10mm}
