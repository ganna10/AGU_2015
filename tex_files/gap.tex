        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ozone levels over central europe are known to be driver by temperature. i.e. increases in temperature correlate with increases in ozone.
            \item Also confirmed in many studies over western and eastern US.
            \item This correlation is shown in many observational studies but modelling studies have tended to focus on the effects of increasing temperature on ozone under specific atmospheric conditions.
            \item How would changing NOx emissions influence the ozone produced with increases in BVOC and chemistry?
            \item Are increased BVOC emissions or increased chemistry more dominant?
