        \begin{itemize}
            \item Lower \ce{NOx} levels produces the least amount of ozone regardless of the increases of emissions and chemistry. Thus, target decreases in \ce{NO_x} emissions.
            \item All chemical mechanisms reproduce the non-linear relationship of ozone on \ce{NO_x} and temperature.
            \item CB05 and RADM2 over-estimate the increases of ozone with temperature compared to detailed chemistry of MCMv3.2.
            \item The treatment of secondary chemistry in CB05 and RADM2 promotes ozone production through more aldehyde production at the expense of ketones which leads to increased levels of acyl peroxy radical (\ce{CH3CO3}). The further degradation on \ce{CH3CO3} produces more ozone.
