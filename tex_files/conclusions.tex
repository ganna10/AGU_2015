        \begin{itemize}
            \item Temperature-dependent chemistry responsible for most of the increase in ozone with temperature. \vspace{20mm}
            \item High-\ce{NO_x} conditions induce largest increases in ozone with temperature. \vspace{20mm}
            \item Non-linear relationship of ozone with temperature and \ce{NO_x} reproduced by all chemical mechanisms. \vspace{20mm}
            \item Representation of chemistry in CB05 and RADM2 produces more ozone than other chemical mechanisms. \vspace{20mm}
