        \begin{itemize}
            \item Lower \ce{NOx} levels produces the least amount of ozone regardless of the increases of emissions and chemistry. \\ \vspace{5mm} $\Rightarrow$ Reducing \ce{NO_x} minimises ozone production despite projected increases in isoprene emissions from vegetation. \vspace{10mm}
            \item All chemical mechanisms reproduce the non-linear relationship of ozone on \ce{NO_x} and temperature. \vspace{15mm}
            \item Percent increase in ozone with temperature from chemistry is larger than that from increased isoprene emissions. Largest increases in ozone with temperature under high-\ce{NO_x} conditions. \vspace{15mm}
